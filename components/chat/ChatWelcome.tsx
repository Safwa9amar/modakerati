// The welcome artwork. Everything below is sized off the image's own aspect
// ratio, so a different picture needs no other change.
//
// This was briefly an animated GIF. It went back to a still because GIF carries
// only 1-bit alpha: every soft edge pixel is forced fully on or fully off, and
// since the animation was generated against black, the ones it kept were a dark
// navy that read as a speckled fringe around the robot on the light theme. A
// PNG has real 8-bit alpha and no such edge. Anything animated here wants a
// format that can hold partial transparency — Lottie or Rive, not GIF.

 * it sat in the transcript as a real message — it could be read aloud,
 * regenerated, and counted toward "has history". A rendered empty state says the
