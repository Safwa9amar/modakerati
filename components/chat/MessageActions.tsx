// The row under a finished assistant answer.
//
// TWO JOBS, in this order, kept apart by a hairline:
//
//   1. WHERE TO GO — the Writer, the Library, the student's Tasks. Labelled
//      chips, first in the row, because they are why the row is worth its space:
//      these are the app's three destinations and the conversation is its front
//      door. They used to live in the drawer, which put every trip to the
//      document behind a swipe.
//   2. WHAT TO DO WITH THIS ANSWER — share, expand, regenerate. Bare glyphs,
//      after the rule, in the quiet way every assistant app draws them.
//
// The chips are labelled and the glyphs are not, deliberately: an unlabelled
// document icon sitting next to Share reads as one more thing to do to the text
// rather than a place to go.
//
// Copy and read-aloud were here and are gone — the row could not hold eight
// controls on a phone, and between them and the three destinations the
// destinations are what a student reaches for. Sharing still hands over the
// text, which is what copying was mostly used for.
//
// Every control does something REAL. Writer and Tasks are simply ABSENT when
// there is no thesis to open, rather than present and dead.
