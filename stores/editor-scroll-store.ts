// Remembers WHERE in the Lexical Writer the user was, PER thesis, so re-entering
// the editor lands there instead of at the top. The Writer scrolls inside its DOM
// WebView; leaving the workspace (back) unmounts that WebView and a Preview
// round-trip re-keys it — both reset it to the top.
//
// We store a BLOCK ANCHOR, not a raw pixel offset: figures load asynchronously and
// reflow the page after a fresh mount, so a pixel offset would land in the wrong
// place. Anchoring to "the block that was at the top of the viewport + how far it
// was scrolled past" survives that reflow (we scroll that block back to the same
// spot once it — and the images above it — have laid out). `y` is a raw fallback.
//
// PERSISTED to AsyncStorage so the position also survives an app reload/quit (not
// just a session). Kept OUTSIDE workspace-store on purpose: that store is reset()
// on every workspace-leave, which would wipe the value we need on the next entry.
