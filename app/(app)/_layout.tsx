// `gestureEnabled: false` — the LEADING EDGE BELONGS TO THE DRAWER. The native
// stack's interactive back-swipe lives in the same strip and, on any screen with
// something behind it, wins the touch, so the edge-swipe appeared to work on the
// workspace (stack root, nothing to pop) and nowhere else. Going back is the back
// arrow's job now, and every screen the drawer opens has one.
// The three destinations that hang off an assistant answer (see
// components/chat/MessageActions). They GROW OUT OF THE CHIP that opened them
// and collapse back into it on close, so the chat reads as the place they came
// from rather than as somewhere the navigator moved on from.
//
// The native transition is switched OFF here on purpose. That movement is not a
// stack animation — it is anchored to a point the navigator knows nothing about
// — so it is done by `components/ZoomFromOrigin`, which each of these three
// screens wraps its content in. Leaving a native animation on would run a slide
// underneath the zoom and the two would fight.
//
// `animation: "none"`, NOT `presentation: "modal"`, for the separate reason that
// the drawer is not part of this navigator: `PushDrawer` WRAPS it (see
// app/_layout.tsx), sliding the whole stack aside as one piece with the panel as
// a sibling behind. A native modal is presented above that entire arrangement,
// so a modal screen's hamburger — and the hamburger on anything pushed onward
// from it, the Writer opened from the Library or from a task run — would open
// the drawer BEHIND the sheet.
