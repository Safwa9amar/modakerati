// The plan's thesis ceiling, and the ONE wording every door uses to explain it.

// A free student may hold ONE thesis. The server refuses all four creation paths
// (POST /api/thesis, /import, /combine, and the assistant's create_thesis), and
// the starting-point screen shows the reason as a card before the student picks
// anything — but an import or a combine begins by asking for their files and then
// spends tens of seconds on them, so those two ask BEFORE the picker opens.
//
// Everything here is server-first: the cached counter is only a way to answer
// fast, and a stale one is how the student got this far. Being unable to read it
// lets them THROUGH — the server still refuses, and a counter we could not load
// must never be the thing that stops somebody who is entitled.
